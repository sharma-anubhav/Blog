<b>Snake</b>, Who needs a nokia just to enjoy a classic old school snake whe you can code it yourself and make it a rather learning experience (before wasting time playing it ;) ).
<br>
While most of the people use an array for implimenting this particular game, i was new to linked list and its visualisation kind of looked like a snake hence i got the idea to code this very game.
<br>
Here's a simulation of the good old snake game which will make you reminisce your childhood days.<br>
