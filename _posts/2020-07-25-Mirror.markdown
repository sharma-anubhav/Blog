Looking deep into his eyes
I see all the childhood cries.
I see all the guilt that no one ever knew
With time that only grew.

Looking at him I see straight through his lies
I see a light inside that never dies.
I listen even when he doesn't speak
I see the strength even when he is weak.

Looking at him I see a friend
That was there scince the begining
And will be with me till the end.

I am looking at a mirror on the wall....
