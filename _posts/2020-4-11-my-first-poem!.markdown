As i walk down this memory lane<br>
searching for something lost <br>
buried under a world of pain<br>
was something with a greater cost<br>
<br>
A mother's love and father's care<br>
with our brothers that we share<br>
is all that i ever desire,<br>
for it I'll even walk the wire<br>
<br>
Bound by these dire straits<br>
on my shoulder the world's weight<br>
i wont bow down crying<br>
untill I am done trying<br>
<br>
The lights will guide you home<br>
a place where you're not alone<br>
and there's still a hope<br>
of a better future exists a scope.
