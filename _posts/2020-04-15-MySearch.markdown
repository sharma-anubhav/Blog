<b>MySearch </b>Webscraping application I made using BeautifulSoup. Mostly What we are looking for lies in the top 2-3 links of our google results. So this application opens them direcly in seperate tabs and omits the the google page entirely.
You can open youtube results or news results or have the headlines printed directly.
<br>
You need enter the search phrase and category (webpages/news/video) and it will automatically open the the relavent pages in your browser window.
